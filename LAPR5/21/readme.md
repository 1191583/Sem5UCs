# US 5.1.21

## 1. Context

This task appears in the start of the project's development, to be able to edit a existing operation type.


## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.21** As an Admin, I want to edit existing operation types, so that I can update or correct information about the procedure. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admins can search for and select an existing operation type to edit. 
- Editable fields include operation name, required staff by specialization, and estimated duration. 
- Changes are reflected in the system immediately for future operation requests. 
- Historical data is maintained, but new operation requests will use the updated operation type information.


**Dependencies/References:**

It is also required that the user is registered and logged in as an admin.
